I think that programming is such a useful tool, and I love the empowerment that people feel when they realize how they can use it to solve problems. My favorite language is Python, but I also like HTML because it appeals to my creative side. Although I don't currently teach any of the programming classes at North, I have taught Intro to Computer Science and Intro to Programming."},

I am a student of the class of 2028, and I've had a great interest in mathematics and science, which is just some of the reasons why I decided to join Programming Club. I've always loved computers ever since I was in elementary school, and I've always wondered how I can create things on a computer. That's when I learned about coding, and ever since I started basic, going more advanced, my knowledge expanded faster than a cheetah could run. My favorite coding language (and most challenging, of course) is C, one of the oldest languages. I am still learning, and I am willing to learn more and help others. My favorite parts of Programming Club are the challenges from short problems we attempt to solve (yes, that's how we practice coding!) The varieties and possibilities in programing are endless, and I think Programming Club is a really insightful club to think about!"},
