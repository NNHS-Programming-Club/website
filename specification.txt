Description of JS and Bootstrap use:
When you hover over the h1 text in my site, it will rotate between the colors of the ranbow, then switch back to orange when you stop. Additionally when you click on the name in the top right corner it switches to "Error 418". I used bootstrap to make "nav-link"s for the top of the page and the footer.

Uses react, react-dom, react-router-dom, bootstrap 4
